Initial commit.
Good template for running a website webserver.

Just add/edit files in rpcListener/ and templates/

Modify config_file to suit needs.

Run and enjoy.

Missing:
1. Move logging lines to LogMessages.go
2. Cleanup logging lines
3. Parse all of RpcConf in Serve.go before starting (like TLS)
